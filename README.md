# Predicting_Falcon_9_First_Stage_Reusability
Data science project predicting Falcon 9 first-stage reusability to optimize launch costs. Simulating a scenario for Space Y, a new competitive company, the project involves data analysis, dashboards, and machine learning models to forecast landing success, inspired by SpaceX's reusable rocket technology. 
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if this alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch
